# temperature-convertor
A program to convert temperature from one unit of measure to another.

#Introduction:

This project demonstrates the creation of a Temperature Converter using Java. The converter enables the transformation of temperatures across different units, including Celsius, Fahrenheit, and Kelvin. Designed as a Command Line Interface (CLI) application, this system boasts a user-friendly and straightforward interface. So, take a moment, enjoy a cup of coffee, and dive into the ease of temperature conversions with the Temperature Converter!

#Explanation

This Command Line Interface serves as a Temperature Converter, allowing users to effortlessly convert temperatures among various units such as Celsius, Fahrenheit, and Kelvin. With its straightforward design, users can swiftly perform temperature conversions through options like Celsius to Fahrenheit, Fahrenheit to Celsius, Celsius to Kelvin, Kelvin to Celsius, Kelvin to Fahrenheit, and Fahrenheit to Kelvin. The system efficiently carries out the conversion process and presents the results to the user.

Utilizing Java, this conversion system incorporates elements such as a while loop, a switch case, and the scanner class. Upon initiation, the system presents users with options like Celsius to Fahrenheit, Fahrenheit to Celsius, Celsius to Kelvin, Kelvin to Celsius, Kelvin to Fahrenheit, Fahrenheit to Kelvin, and an exit option. It then prompts the user for a temperature input and subsequently displays the converted temperature.

Mathematical Formulas Used for Temperature Conversion

To convert the temperature in Celsius to Fahrenheit, “(temperature * 9 / 5) + 32” is used.

To convert the temperature in Fahrenheit to Celsius, “(temperature – 32) * 5 / 9” is used.

To convert the temperature in Celsius to Kelvin, “temperature + 273.15” is used.

To convert the temperature in Kelvin to Fahrenheit, “temperature – 273.15” is used.

To convert the temperature in Kelvin to Celsius, “(temperature – 273.15) * 9 / 5 + 32” is used.

To convert the temperature in Fahrenheit, “(temperature – 32) * 5 / 9 + 273.15;” is used.

Thank You.
